\section{Hopf bifurcation}

Continuing on the upper branch of the pitchfork, we compute (at most) 12 of the eigenvalues closest to the origin after a few steps in $Re.$ After a while we find that a conjugate eigenpair crosses the imaginary axis, which indicates a Hopf bifurcation is nearby. Using the secant procedure to determine at which value of $Re$ the eigenpair is purely imaginary, we find that the Hopf bifurcation is located at $Re_H \approx 68.9781.$
