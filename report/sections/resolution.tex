In order to check whether the accuracy of the solutions in adequate, we changed the resolution of the model. We have determined a branch of steady states in $\eta$ for grid resolutions $32\times 32$, $64\times 64$, $96\times 96$, $128\times 128$ and $160\times 160$. In figure \ref{fig:grids}, the resulting streamfunctions are shown for three grid sizes. A quick look tells us that the shapes of the solutions are the same. For a more accurate approach, we have plotted in figure \ref{fig:errors} the difference between the value at three points of the streamfunction for different grid sizes (Diff). In these figure, the straight line ($\sim/N^2$) is a reference to determine whether the accuracy is second order. When we compare Diff with $\sim/N^2$, we see that the solution, for grid sizes around $128\times 128$ is approximately second order accurate. We can also see, that when we refine the grid to sizes larger than $128\times 128$, the error reduces only by a term of order $10^{-2}$, so we conclude that $128\times 128$ is small enough.
